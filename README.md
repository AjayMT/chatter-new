# Chattr, The Meteor Chat App

Chattr is a simple chat app created with Meteor (http://www.meteor.com). It uses Meteor's auth system, and allows users to
sign in with Facebook, Twitter, or Google. Chattr is in progress, so it still might be a 
bit buggy.

## Installation And Running

To install Chattr:

1. Install Meteor: `$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | /bin/sh`

2. Clone this repo: `$ git clone http://github.com/AjayMT/chatter-new.git/`

3. Run the app: `$ cd chatter-new/chattr; meteor`

#### Note:

Chattr is a better version of my previous app, Chatter. I am still keeping Chatter's source code for those who want it, but
that project is closed.
